#### Recap of Thes Steps:
##### ICM20648 IMU Sensor
After you add/install the *IMU - Inertial Measurement Unit*, you will see some files were added. For example, *sl_icm20648.c* and *sl_icm20648.h* will be added.  
**Note:** These files are driver file prepared by Silabs for ICM-20648. If you use sensor from another vendor, you need implement the similar driver by your own.  
![IMU Driver](/images/Lab_icm20648_driver.png)  

##### IMU GATT Service
After you add/install the *Inertial Measurement Unit GATT Service*, you will see somes other files was added.  
![GATT Service](/images/Lab_GATT_Service.png)  

If you open the *config->btconf->gatt_configuration.btcon* *Bluetooth GATT configurator* file, you could see the *Acceleration* and *Orientation* was added.  
![GATT Acceleration](/images/Lab_Acceleration_Orientation.png)  

In file *sl_event_handler.c*, you could see the API *sl_gatt_service_imu_step* was added into the routine *sl_internal_app_process_action*.  

```
void sl_internal_app_process_action(void)
{
  sl_gatt_service_imu_step();
}
```
  
**Note**: UUID for Acceleration and Orientation could be attained in this step.  

### Adding the Project Source Files
18. Copy [app.c](/source/app.c) source file to the top level of the project. 
The source files (automatically generated and added files included) and code details are found at the *Code Explanation* section of this doc. *app.c* will overwrite the existing file to add the new application. The source files can be dragged and dropped into Simplicity Studio or placed in this file path:  
*C:\Users\user_acount\SimplicityStudio\v5_workshop\soc_spi_acc*  
Where *user_acount* is the default workspace and Simplicity Stduio installation path.  
You can also edit the *app.c* file manually if you prefer to this way.  

### Build and Flash the Project
19. Build the project by clicking on the *hammer* icon in the top left corner of the Simplicity Studio *IDE perspective*. 
Right-click on the *hex* file (under *GNU ARM xxx - Debug*) and select *Flash to Device...* to make the *Flash Programmer* window appear.  
**Note**: Don't use the *bin* image.  
**Note**: If a Device Selection window appears, select the correct device.  

20. Click *Program* to flash the device.  
**Note**: The EFR32BG22 has additional security features and in some cases (i.e., when the board is first plugged in), the tools will prompt to query the *Debug Challenge Interface* (DCI). Select the connected device and then the link for *Click to Query Lock Status*. The device target to program text will no longer be grayed out and then select *OK*.

## Code Explanation
The following sections explain critical lines of code pertinent to this lab. The code can be found in different files (driver).  
### Accelerometer (icm-20648) Driver
#### sl_icm20648_config.h
This is a header file generated automatically by the Simplicity Studio *pintool/software component*. You may need to change the pin map based on your hardware.  
Use the *software components->Platform->Board drivers->ICM20648->Configure* to change this.  
![pintool](/images/Lab_pintool.png)  
The pin map for ICM20648 is here:
![Pin map](/images/Lab_pinmap.png)  

#### sl_icm20648.c
This file is located in folder like  
*C:\SiliconLabs\SimplicityStudio\v5\developer\sdks\gecko_sdk_suite\v3.1\hardware\driver\icm20648\src*  
This is the driver file for ICM-20648 sensor prepared by Silabs.  
![File path](/images/Lab_filePath.png)  

If you use sensor from another vendor, you may need to consider implementing the similar driver for it.  
Please consider contacting with the vendor of the sensor you use to get help on how implementing the driver.  

#### sl_imu_fuse.c/sl_imu.c/sl_sensor_imu.c
These are re-pack of the API provided in driver sl_icm20648.c. The high-level code (app.c) call API like *sl_sensor_imu_init*, *sl_sensor_imu_get* and others provided in these files to initialize and enable/disable the IMU sensor.  
These files are in folder like below:  

*C:\SiliconLabs\SimplicityStudio\v5\developer\sdks\gecko_sdk_suite\v3.1\hardware\driver\imu\src*  
*C:\SiliconLabs\SimplicityStudio\v5\developer\sdks\gecko_sdk_suite\v3.1\app\bluetooth\common\sensor_imu*  

### Application (app.c)

The *SoC Empty* project generates a default [*app.c*](/source/app.c) source file with a skeleton Bluetooth event handler. The *app.c* file provided for this lab adds code to handle the BLE connection and notifications.  

#### Connection Opened
The IMU sensor is initialized and enabled when event *sl_bt_evt_connection_opened_id* received. The IMU sampling does not start until a connection has been *made* and the user has enabled GATT *Acceleration Notification* (or *Orientation Notification*) characteristics.  

```
    static void sensor_init(void)
    {
      sl_sensor_imu_init();
      sl_sensor_imu_enable(true);
    }
    
    // -------------------------------
    // This event indicates that a new connection was opened.
    case sl_bt_evt_connection_opened_id:
      sensor_init();
      break;
      
```

#### Connection Closed
When the connection is *closed*, the *sl_bt_evt_connection_closed_id* event is triggered. To save power when no devices are connected the sensor was disabled via *sensor_deinit* function.  

```
    // -------------------------------
    // This event indicates that a connection was closed.
    case sl_bt_evt_connection_closed_id:
      // Restart advertising after client has disconnected.
      sc = sl_bt_advertiser_start(
        advertising_set_handle,
        advertiser_general_discoverable,
        advertiser_connectable_scannable);
      sl_app_assert(sc == SL_STATUS_OK,
                    "[E: 0x%04x] Failed to start advertising\n",
                    (int)sc);
      break;
```

### BLE Notification
Once the user has *enabled* GATT notifications to the characteristic, the *sl_bt_evt_gatt_server_characteristic_status_id event* is triggered. In this event, the device will periodically update the characteristic value until the device *disconnects*.  

// Isaac, expand this part!!!  

#### sl_event_handler.c
This file was automatically generated and was in folder (workspace) here:  

*C:\Users\delu\SimplicityStudio\v5_workshop\soc_spi_acc\autogen*  

```
    void sl_internal_app_process_action(void)
    {
      sl_gatt_service_imu_step();
    }
```

#### sl_gatt_service_imu.c
This file was in folder like below:  

*C:\SiliconLabs\SimplicityStudio\v5\developer\sdks\gecko_sdk_suite\v3.1\app\bluetooth\common\gatt_service_imu*  

```
    void sl_gatt_service_imu_step(void)
    {
      if (imu_state) {
        if (SL_STATUS_OK == sl_gatt_service_imu_get(imu_ovec, imu_avec)) {
          if (imu_acceleration_notification) {
            imu_acceleration_notify();
          }
          if (imu_orientation_notification) {
            imu_orientation_notify();
          }
        }
      }
    }
```

## Porting Consideration
### Other Drivers
EFR32BG22 Thunderboard also integrated other sensors:  
- Silabs Relative humidity & temperature sensor: I2C [Si7021](https://www.silabs.com/sensors/humidity/si7006-13-20-21-34)  
- Silabs UV and ambient light sensor: I2C [Si1133](https://www.silabs.com/sensors/optical/si1133)  
- Silabs Hall effect sensor: I2C [Si7210](https://www.silabs.com/sensors/magnetic/si7210)  

If your solution needs these sensors, you may use similar procedure to add them.  

### Bootloader
The application generated via *SoC Empty* project don't have the bootloader.  
Ensure to program the bootloader to the device first. In some cases, the bootloader may be missing from the device if it has been completely erased. If that happens:  
-  Optional solutions:  
    -  Open the Flash Programmer and program the bootloader found here:  
    *C:\SiliconLabs\SimplicityStudio_v5\developer\sdks\gecko_sdk_suite\v3.1\platform\bootloader\sample-apps\bootloader-storage-internal-single-512k\efr32mg22c224f512im40-brd4182a\bootloader-storage-internal-single-512k.s37*  
    -  Flash a demo example first (like *Bluetooth SOC - thunderboard EFR32BG22*), then flash the application got here.
